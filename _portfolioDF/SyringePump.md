## Project Motivation

Syringe Pumps are commonly used in a plethora of medical scenarios to dispense precise quantities of medicine over 
an extended duration and in a fully automated way. However, these devices cost thousands of dollars despite not 
being extraordinarily complicated.

This project aims to use basic CAD, programming, and electronics principles to create a functional syringe pump on a 
minimal budget.
